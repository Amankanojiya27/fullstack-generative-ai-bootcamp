Full Stack Generative &amp; Agentic AI with Python course — covering Python, Git, Docker, LLMs, RAG, LangChain, LangGraph, Agents, and Model Context Protocol (MCP).


# 🧠 Full Stack Generative & Agentic AI with Python

Welcome to my personal repository documenting my learning journey through the **Full Stack Generative and Agentic AI Bootcamp** — a hands-on course covering everything from Python and Docker to LangChain, RAG, LangGraph, and AI Agents.

---

## 🎯 Course Overview

This repository includes my notes, code exercises, and projects from the course:

> **Hands-on guide to modern AI** — Tokenization, Agents, RAG, Vector DBs, and deploying scalable AI apps.

By the end, I’ll have built and deployed real-world AI systems using the same technologies powering ChatGPT, Gemini, and Claude.
